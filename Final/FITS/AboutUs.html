<h1>Our Story</h1>
<p>Bronx...Community Engagement FUN IN THE SON (FITS) is a family friendly festival that is staged annually in the North East  Bronx.  The festival features faith based music and positive inspiring messages.   The festive environment also include vendors showcasing their businesses, special activities for children, youth and the elderly.  Food, clothing and back to school supplies are distributed to support the large number of single mothers and low income residents in the Bronx. <br> 
<br> 


Each year, three villages are showcased to meet the needs of our surrounding community and provide activities where all have their needs addressed. Our “healthy village” focuses on preventative care, health, and nutrition education resources for the community. Our “children's village” features rides, games, team building exercises, and a school supply give away to the children. The “Partner Spotlight”  gives our partners and sponsors ongoing opportunities to connect with attendees throughout the day.<br> 
<br> 

​

The FITS festival has sustained its success record because of the collaboration between the faith community, the business district and elected officials joining together and accessing the resources to make it happen.<br> 
<br> 
​

Good Neighbors Community Outreach Agency(GNCOA) is the catalyst for this festival.  Serving the community for over 20 years they facilitate access to affordable housing, job creation opportunities, education, training and youth empowerment programs. GNCOA is a 501c3 community-based organization that provides services to a variety of under-served groups such as widows, orphans, single mothers, the homeless, and youth.  GNCOA  is located at  3350-56 Seymour Avenue, Bronx, NY 10469.<br> 
<br> 


The FITS Festival started in 2002 on the island of Jamaica by Glory Music, an Event Planning, Artists Booking Agency in the Caribbean. Initially geared towards college students, the festival offered a fun-filled alternative to traditional spring break activities. Today, FITS is an international festival with concerts being held in Haiti, Jamaica, and The United States. Through the years, numerous internationally acclaimed artists have graced the FITS stages including Hezekiah Walker, Kirk Franklin, Tye Tribbett, Tobi Mac, Martha Munizzi, Israel Houghton, Eddie James, Papa San, Carlene Davis, Out Of Eden, Alvin Slaughter, JJ Hairston, and Pastor Donnie McClurkin to name a few. <br> 

​<br> 

Over the past  seven years, FITS Bronx has attracted and impacted over 70,000 persons. Attendees of our festival have left with hope and an appreciation for the services and resources available to them through the businesses and social service organizations in attendance. We look forward to the coming years when many who are being lifted out of poverty will return to lend a helping hand to the next generation!  </p>
