    <h1 style =  "color: orange" >John Berger's Ways of Seeing Response</h1>
    <p> John Berger's Ways of Seeing reinforces the idea of perspective and how heavily perspective impacts art and how the audience percieves said art. One of the moments that stood out to me was when they showed how simply changing the channel affected the content of the episode being shown because context affects art massivly. Context is usually thought of by the artist but becasue of reproduction the control of what context your art is seen in is lost and can and will change or at least affect how your art is seen. </p>

    <p> Berger's anaylsis of the nude also struck out to me because something that is considered empowering to women has been taken and adhered to the male gaze and yet also used to cut down women. women are said to be attention seeking yet most nudes were painted by and made for men. And becasuse of this women have an image to upkeep and consistently think about because of how the rest of the world sees them. This struck out to me becasue these paintings were always seen as high art, they still are but there is an element of dehumanization of the subject that is fascinating to think about and how that has continued over time and what it means to the modern day and the advent of social media and how that has changed how everyone sees themselves and how much their image in the public eye is controlled by what they put out and the response they recieve from it.</p>
    <h4 style = "color:gray"> #ScholarStrike Response</h4>
    <p>The #ScholarStrike was interesting to me because overall scholars have alot of power and influence in this country but from what I've seen they tend not to use their voice on issues like this and it's been nice to see a difference in the IDM department most professors seem socially aware and use theor art for change and that was encourging and inspiring to see from professors. </p>
