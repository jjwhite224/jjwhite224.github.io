    <p style = "color: White; font-family:'Grenze Gotisch'""> The ideas brought up in Vannevar Bush's article are fascinating because it is a glimpse of how people in 1945 viewed technology and the potential it had. Bush's description of a 'memex' is basically a computer and the Internet and speculations about calculators and recording devices were essentially spot on and technology progressed how he envisoned and beyond. Bush describes technology as a double edged sword that can help or hurt humanity and in hindsight he was right, even though it was easy to see as we repeat history. But technology has created a dystopia that I don't think anyone could have forseen. The interent is a vast well of knowledge but having essentially everything known to man at your finger tips is again a double edged sword, especially when that knwoledge and information becomes monetized.   </p>
