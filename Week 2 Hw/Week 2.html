Bush's description of a 'memex' is basically a computer and the Internet and speculations about calculators and recording devices were essentially spot on and technology progressed how he envisoned and beyond. Bush describes technology as a double edged sword that can help or hurt humanity and in hindsight he was right, even though it was easy to see as we repeat history. But technology has created a dystopia that I don't think anyone could have forseen. The interent is a vast well of knowledge but having essentially everything known to man at your finger tips is again a double edged sword, especially when that knowledge and information becomes monetized.   </p>

The trust that users put into companies like facebook consistently puts the users at risk and that type of behavior will lead to a further crackdown on the web. This follows Bush's idea of the dangers brought by the growth and innovation of technology. As the web got bigger and bigger and more personal information was uploaded the responsibility put on these massive companies grew and they choose money over protecting its users. Also, as social networks grew and became hubs of information, the responsibilty was put onto tech companies once again to make sure that the information was reliable and they werent disseminating false information but this was and is a huge task for these large companies so, they couldn't keep up. And the web for all the good its done has become a poisoned chalice that puts country's democracies and even people's lives at risk. </p>
