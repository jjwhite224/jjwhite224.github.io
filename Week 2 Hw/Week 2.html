    <p> The ideas brought up in Vannevar Bush's article are fascinating because it is a glimpse of how people in 1945 viewed technology and the potential it had. Bush's description of a 'memex' is basically a computer and the Internet and speculations about calculators and recording devices were essentially spot on and technology progressed how he envisoned and beyond. Bush describes technology as a double edged sword that can help or hurt humanity and in hindsight he was right, even though it was easy to see as we repeat history. But technology has created a dystopia that I don't think anyone could have forseen. The interent is a vast well of knowledge but having essentially everything known to man at your finger tips is again a double edged sword, especially when that knwoledge and information becomes monetized.   </p>

    <p> Berger's anaylsis of the nude also struck out to me because something that is considered empowering to women has been taken and adhered to the male gaze and yet also used to cut down women. women are said to be attention seeking yet most nudes were painted by and made for men. And becasuse of this women have an image to upkeep and consistently think about because of how the rest of the world sees them. This struck out to me becasue these paintings were always seen as high art, they still are but there is an element of dehumanization of the subject that is fascinating to think about and how that has continued over time and what it means to the modern day and the advent of social media and how that has changed how everyone sees themselves and how much their image in the public eye is controlled by what they put out and the response they recieve from it.</p>
